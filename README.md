#BST Plus

*Version 2.2*

**BST Plus is a WordPress starter theme loaded with Bootstrap 3. It has an increasing number of optional add-ons built in - to name a few examples: navbar drop-down on hover ('Hovernav'), navbar mega-menu 'Meganav'), and WooCommerce support. Simply use what you want, delete (or comment out) what you don't want

BST Plus is the big brother of BST [https://github.com/SimonPadbury/bst](https://github.com/SimonPadbury/bst). It shares the same basic features as BST.

##Basic Features of BST Plus

* *Simple, intuitive, clean code.*
* CSS, JS, functions and template parts are organized into different folders.
* **Bootstrap 3.3.1** - CSS and JS enqueued. You can simply swap the default Bootstrap 3 files (included) for a custom made Bootstrap 3, and this theme will still work.
* **jQuery 1.11.1** either using the hosted Google CDN or WordPress's onboard jQuery. (You decide).
* `Modernizr.js`, `respond.js` and `html5shiv.css` included - enqueued. (Keep what you want; delete what you don't.)
* A starter CSS theme - `css/bst-plus.css`, enqueued. (**Don't** put your own styles in `style.css`.)
* Visual editor stylesheet - into which the same Bootstrap 3 and starter CSS theme are preloaded by `@import`, so that what you see in the visual editor is (mostly!) what you get at the front end (WYSI(M!)WYG). E.g. you will see the theme's typography in the WordPress Post/Page editor, but its width will not be the same as your article column width in the front end.
* Bootstrap pagination ( e.g. `<- Previous | 1 | 2 | 3 | Next ->`) for Blog index and category pages.
* [MIT licence](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT) (open source).

##Optional Features of BST Plus

* [Bootstrap Theme](http://getbootstrap.com/examples/theme/) included.
* jQuery loaded from either Google CDN (with local WordPress fallback), or simply from WordPress. You decide.
* **WooCommerce** plugin support. (You will also need the [WooCommerce plugin] (http://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce/)).
* **Hovernav** - navbar dropdown on hover.
* **Meganav** - navbar mega-menu, which automatically works whenever there are grand-child links (for screen sizes >= 768px).
* In `functions/cleanup.php` there are some filters are included (but commented-out, so are inactive) for removing WordPress IDs and classes from the navbar(s). If you would like to use these filters, then simply un-comment them.
* A few simple jQuery scripts - in `js/bst-plus.js`, enqueued.
* Custom comment list callback.
* **A full-width page template**.
